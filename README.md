# Covey-ethereum

The purpose of this project is to show how to send transactions to ethereum like networks, in this case POLYGON

# Requirements

-   [Infura Node](https://infura.io/) with the polygon add-on enabled.
-   A wallet with some MATIC to transact. Can use this [faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
-   The wallet's private key and address

# Environment Variables you will need

Create a file called `.env` and add the following variables:

-   WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
-   INFURA_PROJECT_ID
-   COVEY_LEDGER_ADDRESS (for polygon the address is `0xAd995FBA14dC6A369faE3c90B81CE0346f4Cf3BC`)
-   WALLET (this is the address of your wallet, it is the private key above)
-   POLYGON_CHAIN_ID (for the polygon testnet it is `80001`)
